D3 tutorial

bare minimum environment setup:
1. HTML page;
2. external js file;

Basic HTML page:
1. document type, HTML;
2. header, declare a dependency on d3.js
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
3. body, 
  a. declare an element with id such as "d3Container"
  b. declare a dependency on a d3 graph, for instance:
     <script src="audi.js"></script>

script can be placed at header or body.

basic api setup:
1. set up a server that provides useful data;

=======
on axes, key takeaways:
1. axis is actually 'axis generator', we use call() method to instruct the generator to draw an axis;
2. axis requires a scale as a parameter;
3. axis configuration: 
  3a: ticks() - defines the number of ticks;
  3b: tickFormat() - use this method for displaying category; 
  3c: tickSize() - use this method for drawing grids;
4. axisBottom actually means the tick orientation is towards the bottom - not the location of the axis;
5. to control the position of an axis, use translate() method;
6. svg.append('g').attr('transform', 'translate(x, y)').call(axis)

on band scale, key takeaways:
1. on 3b, we should use band scale rather than linear scale to present categorical data;
2. scaleBand().domain([arr]).range([pixels]) - map a category to the start position of the range;
3. the circles should be offest by the scaleBand().bandwidth()/2 - align with the ticks of the band;
